# Simple Clock ⏰
## Description
This is a simple, lightweight clock application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock dynamically updates in real-time, displaying the current time in a user-friendly format. It's a great project to understand and demonstrate the use of JavaScript for working with dates and times.

## Features
 - Displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
 - Automatically updates every second.
 - Clean and responsive design.
 - Easy to customize the appearance with CSS.
## Technologies Used
 > HTML5: Structure of the clock.
 > CSS3: Styling the clock for a visually appealing design.
 > JavaScript: Logic for real-time updates and time calculations.
## How It Works
:> JavaScript's setInterval function is used to update the time every second.
:> The Date object is leveraged to fetch the current time.
:>The clock is rendered dynamically by updating the DOM.

## Customization
 - You can easily modify the clock’s appearance by editing the styles.css file:
 - Change colors, fonts, or layout to fit your style.
 - Add new features like date display or different time zones.
